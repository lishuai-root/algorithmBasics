/**
 * @description: You are given a 0-indexed array usageLimits of length n.
 * <p>
 * Your task is to create groups using numbers from 0 to n - 1, ensuring that each number, i, is used no more than usageLimits[i] times in total across all groups. You must also satisfy the following conditions:
 * <p>
 * Each group must consist of distinct numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
 * Each group (except the first one) must have a length strictly greater than the previous group.
 * Return an integer denoting the maximum number of groups you can create while satisfying these conditions.
