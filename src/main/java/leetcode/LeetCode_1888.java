/**
 * @description: You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:
 * <p>
 * Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
 * Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
 * Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.
 * <p>
 * The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.
 * <p>
 * For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.
