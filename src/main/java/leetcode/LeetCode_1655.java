/**
 * @description: You are given an array of n integers, nums, where there are at most 50 unique values in the array.
 * You are also given an array of m customer order quantities, quantity, where quantity[i] is the amount of integers the ith customer ordered. Determine if it is possible to distribute nums such that:
 * <p>
 * The ith customer gets exactly quantity[i] integers,
 * The integers the ith customer gets are all equal, and
 * Every customer is satisfied.
 * Return true if it is possible to distribute nums according to the above conditions.
