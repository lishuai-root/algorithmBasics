/**
 * @description: Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
 * <p>
 * Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.
 * <p>
 * Given the positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, return the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.
 * <p>
 * Notice that all the heaters follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.
