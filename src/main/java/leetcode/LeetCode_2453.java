/**
 * @description: You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers, representing targets on a number line. You are also given an integer space.
 * <p>
 * You have a machine which can destroy targets. Seeding the machine with some nums[i] allows it to destroy all targets with values that can be represented as nums[i] + c * space, where c is any non-negative integer. You want to destroy the maximum number of targets in nums.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum value of nums[i] you can seed the machine with to destroy the maximum number of targets.
