/**
 * @description: A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:
 * <p>
 * words.length == indices.length
 * The reference string s ends with the '#' character.
 * For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].
 * Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words.
