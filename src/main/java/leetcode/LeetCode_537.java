 * @description: A complex number can be represented as a string on the form "real+imaginaryi" where:
 * <p>
 * real is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
 * imaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].
 * i2 == -1.
 * Given two complex numbers num1 and num2 as strings, return a string of the complex number that represents their multiplications.
