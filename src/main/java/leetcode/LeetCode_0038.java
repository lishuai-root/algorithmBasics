/**
 * @description: The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
 * <p>
 * countAndSay(1) = "1"
 * countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1),
 * which is then converted into a different digit string.
 * To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character.
 * Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string,
 * replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.
 * <p>
 * For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Given a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
