/**
 * @description: Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon
 *     subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.
 *     <p>An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of
 *     one string but not the others.
 *     <p>A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of
 *     characters from s.
 *     <p>For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined
 *     characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and
 *     "" (empty string).
